**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is the field of computer science focused on creating machines or systems that can **think, learn, and make decisions like humans**.

In simple terms — AI is when computers are designed to do things that usually require human intelligence, such as:

* 🧠 **Understanding** (language, speech, or images)
* 📊 **Learning** (from data or experience)
* 💬 **Reasoning and problem-solving**
* 🤖 **Acting autonomously** (making decisions without being explicitly told what to do)

| Category               | Example                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Voice Assistants       | Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant                         |
| Recommendation Systems | Netflix suggesting movies, Amazon product suggestions |
| Chatbots               | ChatGPT, customer support bots                        |
| Image Recognition      | Face unlock on phones, traffic cameras                |
| Self-Driving Cars      | Tesla Autopilot, Waymo                                |
| Healthcare             | AI-based disease diagnosis, medical imaging           |

### 🧩 Types of AI

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**

   * Built for a specific task (e.g., chatbots, facial recognition).
   * What we mostly use today.

2. **General AI (Strong AI)**

   * Would think and reason like a human in any situation.
   * Still theoretical — not yet achieved.

3. **Superintelligent AI**

   * Beyond human intelligence in every aspect.
   * A concept explored in research and sci-fi.

### 🧠 How AI Works

AI combines several subfields:

* **Machine Learning (ML):** Teaches computers to learn from data.
* **Deep Learning:** Uses neural networks to learn complex patterns (used in ChatGPT, image recognition, etc.).
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Helps AI understand and generate human language.
* **Computer Vision:** Enables machines to “see” and interpret visual data.
* **Robotics:** Combines AI with sensors and hardware to interact with the physical world.
